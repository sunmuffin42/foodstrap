                Welcome to foodstrap! Here you can browse recipes based on what's in your pantry, so you don't have to worry about thinking something up on your own. If you create an account with us, you'll be able to add what kind of hardware your kitchen has available so we only show you recipes that are possible to complete for you. You'll also get to add allergies and other dietary specifications, so we can avoid showing you recipes you can't eat.
